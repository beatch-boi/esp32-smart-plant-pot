# Smart Plant Pot Firmware

This repository contains prototype firmware for a smart plant pot system. The firmware is designed to monitor environmental conditions (such as temperature, humidity, and water level) and control artificial lighting using UV LEDs. This allows you to grow plants in places without access to natural sunlight.

## Features

- Monitors temperature, humidity, and water level
- Controls three independent UV lighting sections
- Web-based interface for monitoring and control
- Preset management for lighting schedules and brightness
- Wi-Fi connectivity (STA/AP modes)

## Note

This is a working prototype and **not a finished system**. Some features may be incomplete or experimental.

## Usage

1. Flash the firmware to your ESP32 device.
2. Connect to the device via Wi-Fi or your local network.
3. Access the web interface to monitor and control the plant pot.
